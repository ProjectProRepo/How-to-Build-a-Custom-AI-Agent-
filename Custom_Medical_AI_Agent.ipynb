The patient may also want to consider adjusting their diet and exercise routine to maintain stable blood glucose levels, particularly in the morning when levels tend to be highest. Additionally, the patient should be aware of the subtle upward trend from 2022-01-01 to 2022-01-05 and the slight downward trend from 2022-01-05 to 2022-01-07, and take steps to address these fluctuations.
